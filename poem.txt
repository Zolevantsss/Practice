sometimes a voice
low tone, even pitch
quiet awareness lush beneath
the rumble of thought
searches me
streams through currents
that bind the medium
I call my self, this body I am
deliberate and awake
voice, my intimate, radiant
passes through and over
beneath and beyond
and from the cell emanates
sent forth and received
